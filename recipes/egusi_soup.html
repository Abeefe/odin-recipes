    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Egusi soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and
      <br />
      Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to
      <br />
      try something different every once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor. <br />
      If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. <br />
      Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used in place of
      the shrimp. <br />
      Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.

        You can roast the egusi seeds in a dry pan over low heat for 5-7 minutes
        <br />
        to enhance their flavor before grinding them.

      <li>
        Use a blender or food processor to grind the egusi seeds into a fine
        powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired consistency for the
        soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can add other vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, or potatoes to
        the soup if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Egusi soup is traditionally served with fufu, a staple made from cassava
        <br />
        flour or plantain flour. You can also serve it with rice or other
        staples.
