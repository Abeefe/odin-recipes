      <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic,
        ginger,<br />
        and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.<br />
        Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5
        minutes.<br />
        Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2
        to 3 minutes.<br />
        Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric;
        <br />
        continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice
        <br />
        is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon
        paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer.
        <br />
        Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer
        <br />
        for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. <br />
        Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork,
        <br />
        separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped
        cilantro.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>
      If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing.
      <br />
      Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again,
      <br />
      and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again.
